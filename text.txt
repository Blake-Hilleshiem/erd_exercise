My ERD is made for an accounting app that will be a one stop spot to see all your paid and future bills, and compare your balance with your bank statement. 

Examples:
1:1
  One example of a 1:1 relationship is each user will only have one user_id.

1:many
  An example of a 1:many relationship can be found in the Service_plans. As a single user can be referenced in many service plans.

many:many
  Lastely, an example of a many:many relationship is in the Subscriptions and Users tables. A user can have many subscription_id's and a subscription can have many user_id's. (for like tracking purposes)
